I've written some thoughts on culture, moderation, and the like within for this discord server.

Branches should be named `<paper-folder-name>/dev` or `<paper-folder-name>/<id/><feature-descr>`.
Optional id can be the first four digits of a [v4 UUI](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) if you're worried about name collisions.
Use `meta` as the folder name if we do work on the root folder.

Merge features into dev and then dev into folder.
